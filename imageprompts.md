  Battle Map

  Core Objective: A high-detail, Zenith-view (90-degree top-down) tactical battle map.

  Perspective: Absolute orthographic projection. Zero perspective distortion. Every object must be seen
  from directly above (no visible sides of walls, trees, or furniture).

  Style: 'Grim Realism.' Focus on high-fidelity natural textures, weather-worn surfaces, and atmospheric
  lighting that defines the mood of the specific locale.

  Lighting: Use localized light sources (e.g., torches, magical glows, windows, campfires) to create
  high-contrast shadows. Use subtle color grading and painterly shading to indicate elevation changes
  (height) without using 3D tilt.

  Strict Constraints: 1. No UI, no text, no labels, and no symbols. 2. No baked-in grids, borders, or
  lines. 3. No "Cinematic" depth-of-field or blur; the entire map must be in sharp focus. 4. Do not show
  bridges or structures unless explicitly requested in the specific scene description.

  Generic Image

  Create a highly detailed, full-view illustration of a single object, set against an artistic, visually
  rich background. Use focused lighting to accentuate the object's form, texture, and design, while
  allowing the background to be dynamic and layered. The image should be entirely visual—without any
  text, symbols, or markings—and rendered as a perfect square (1:1 aspect ratio).
